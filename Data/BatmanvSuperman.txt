1 Lex did mention the Meta-Human thesis (JL) in the beginning. So showing the JL in his file did not feel forced. #BatmanvSuperman
2 Interested the see what Jay has to say about #BatmanvSuperman? Check out the Blog 42's newest post, "Batman vs. Superman vs. the Critics"
3 Gonna watch #BatmanvSuperman for the third time, after that there will shall be a review!!!!   #BetterLateThanNever
4 "If you seek his monument, look around you" 😭😭😭 #BatmanvSuperman
5 @cfortsgottalock finally saw #BatmanvSuperman such an amazing movie
6 Those #WonderWoman drums! Dum-dum-dum-da-dum-dum-dum. She held off that monster ON HER OWN. She's freakin' #HillaryClinton. #BatmanvSuperman
7 That Chris Stuckmann script rewrite of #BatmanvSuperman might be the most hilarious and atrocious thing I've ever read
8 I could rave about #BatmanvSuperman all night but I'm not going to. What I will say is that it's been SORELY underrated.
9 sounds like treat us like idiot.　＞＞Still trying to figure out #BatmanvSuperman?
10 Guess who's gonna watch #BatmanvSuperman for a 5th time tonight?! Yup.
11 Saw #BatmanvSuperman. Enjoyable if somewhat weakly written, spoiling good characters/actors. Lex Luthor rocks nonetheless.
12 Wow... #BatmanvSuperman is terrible. I was really hoping the reviews were wrong, but no... It is bad. #Sadface
13 #BatmanvSuperman was awesome, I guess. :)
14 In case you were wondering #BatmanvSuperman is not improved by a 2nd viewing.
15 Superman : "Yo bats, I'm kinda being threatened to fight you, can ya give me a hand" Batman: *brood* "for JUSTICE" #batmanvsuperman
16 #BatmanvSuperman who won? Marvel. #HeyNow
17 The 1 thing that I took away from #BatmanvSuperman is now I can put a face to the voice of ElastiGirl from The Incredibles
18 Just watched Batman vs superman again. It was even better than the first time! #BatmanvSuperman #batman #superman #DC
19 Two hours till I see #BatmanvSuperman movie. Think I'll like it?
20 @themeltingfaces @Scottdiavolo @joelnerd Well.. Went 2 See #BatmanvSuperman ... And Although NOT A Fan.. I LOVED  It. @BatmanvSuperman
21 Going to see Batman vs. Superman at the movies #BatmanvSuperman
22 #BatmanvSuperman dont like the movie at all...all mis cast!
23 And how many CNN reporters are in this movie? Holy frijoles. #BatmanvSuperman
24 You can tell most of Snyder's version of superman critics have never read the comic 'for the man who has everything' #BatmanvSuperman
25 If people wanted more humor/fun in #batmanvsuperman, they should go see #suicidesquad in August. They'll probably enjoy it
26 #BatmanvSuperman - Roman Reigns vs John Cena (Coming soon)
27 They fitted the storyline according to the graphics they could make and some quirky lines #BatmanvSuperman
28 I'm watching #SupermanII and it is so much better than #BatmanvSuperman #somuchbetter #genehackmanislexluthor #generalzod
29 #BatmanvSuperman is quite literally like a Blade Runner of superhero movies. It hit me in the moments leading to Martha. @krummbum @derbykid
30 How did Diana Prince have time to run off the plane,change into her outfit , arrive in time and take her nail polish off? #BatmanvSuperman
31 First thing's first, I've read about Snyder's 4 hour long #BatmanVSuperman director's cut. I would watch the shit out of it! 😂
32 Wow #BatmanvSuperman was bad. Like really bad 👎🏼
33 Took my 72-year-old mother to #BatmanvSuperman #11 and she smiled and giggled when Wonder Woman saved Batman. She loved the movie.
34 I've created superheroes called Non-sequitur-man, Contrivo and Token Girl. Now to make a film about them. Oh, too late. #BatmanvSuperman
35 @JesseEisenberg as Lex Luthor sucks. @BenAffleck as Batman sucks. #BatmanvSuperman #badcasting
36 Enjoyed #BatmanvSuperman. Very well acted. Better than I expected.
37 1/4  I watched #BatmanvSuperman  1. The creature at the end is ridiculous 2. #Batman beating violently Superman was heartbreaking 3. Batman
38 On Monday, catch my train on morning going to Cache-Cache to buy some #Oora outfits then seeing #BatmanvSuperman then buying some food to -
39 #BatmanvSuperman - also helps that (for me) Cavill is the first 'dangerous' looking #Superman. Not camp despite the whole underpants thing.
40 @Yasmindirir just before our souls were snatched from us 🙃#BatmanvSuperman
41 I wonder if #Zootopia will end up with a higher domestic box office than #BatmanvSuperman. Currently, $3M lower, but holding up better.
42 Just came back from #BatmanvSuperman and WOW just WOW. @RealHansZimmer @Junkie_XL the score is AMAZING!!!
43 @cineworld I was wondering if you were doing the collectable cups for #CivilWar as Ive got both #StarWarsTheForceAwakens &amp; #BatmanvSuperman
44 How critics wanted fight, Supes:"torrid blah blah blah Bats:"horiffic blah blah blah Ma Kent: AAAAHH (burned to death) #BatmanvSuperman
45 🚫🌞#BatmanvSuperman           Theater Experience:             4💰 Out Of 5💰        Overall: 7🍿Out Of 12🍿🌚🚫
46 #BatmanvSuperman I WAS ABOUT TO LOOSE MY FUCKING SHIT OMD THIS CLOSE
47 Well finally saw #BatmanvSuperman thought it was an ok movie a little long winded in places but still a good watch
48 Just saw #BatmanvSuperman and it was great, loved every second of it. Keep up the good work @DCComics
49 Watched batman v superman for second time and it was better then the first time i think. It is actually a good movie.. #bvs #batmanvsuperman
50 BvS isn't like other superhero movies which is what makes it so good! 👌👏 #BatmanvSuperman #dawnofjustice #DCComics
51 First off, fuck pointless semi-foreboding dream sequences #BatmanvSuperman
52 Your mom had the same name as my mom? Ok, I won't kill you. BFFs? #BatmanvSuperman
53 @kunalnayyar judging by the teaser in #BatmanvSuperman, Raj will now want to play #aquaman?
54 @24k #BatmanvSuperman was the last movie I saw and I really liked it. This summer is gonna be epic tho with all these new movies!
55 #BatmanVSuperman summed up:  Random scenes Batman hates supes More random scenes Batman fights supes Moms have the same name  They team up
1 #BatmanvSuperman was great. Idk what's wrong with people.
2 The more I think about #BatmanvSuperman, the less I like it.
3 Worst portrayal of me.... ever!!!  #BatmanVSuperman
4 I was surprised they got away with the bones popping out in the PG-13 cut tho #BatmanvSuperman
5 People, it's time to let the healing begin. I've seen too much suffering. Admit it. #BatmanvSuperman sucks. Say it. You'll feel better.
6 There are people who actually believe that Disney paid reviewers to pan #BatmanvSuperman like somehow that's a viable business strategy
7 #BatmanvSuperman sucked &amp; #TaxationIsTheft
8 Just saw #BatmanvSuperman again, and man, that film is so freaking awesome. Every reference is linked to something. Best one yet!
9 @markhughesfilms @CaptainAmerica fantastic article Mark, really liked #BatmanvSuperman and pumped for #CaptainAmericaCivilWar
10 Check out @BrandonLaws and I talkin' #Daredevil s2 #BatmanvSuperman #Blazers and #Batfleck with special guest @joshdurh12
11 Superman is the only one paying attention to the wait staff at Lex's party in #BatmanvSuperman
12 @johncampea do you think that #BatmanVSuperman should have been split into two movies?? #TJCP
13 Newest episode is up the boys are talkin' #Daredevil s2 #BatmanvSuperman #Blazers and #Batfleck with special guest @joshdurh12
14 I want to see the longest version of #BatmanvSuperman possible so that the 'I kidnapped your mom' scene feels like an even bigger cop out.
15 I think I'm going to make the boy go see #TheJungleBook instead of #BatmanvSuperman
16 #doom is going to be as disappointing as #BatmanvSuperman. Shame. No one cares about diehard fans.
17 #BatmanvSuperman even better second viewing haters are being ridiculous
18 #superman is a billion times better than #CRAPtonamerica #batmanvsuperman #CaptainAmericaCivilWar #HenryCavill
19 What were Lex Luthor's motivations in #BatmanvSuperman?
20 About to watch this @BatmanvSuperman let's see what's up #movietime #familytime #BatmanvSuperman
21 FINALLY got around to watching #BatmanvSuperman and 😱👌🏾👍🏾
22 To be honest, @TheJungleBook is the best movie I've seen this year and #BatmanvSuperman is the absolute worst.
23 Man I got a bad case of the feels at the end of #BatmanvSuperman and I don't even really like Superman like that. Stupid Zack Snyder. HACK
24 Who would've thought Perry White's line from Batman v. Superman would come back in play. "...'Water is wet.'!" #BatmanvSuperman
25 Seeing #BatmanvSuperman  I'm a little late, but that's how I roll.
26 #BatmanvSuperman because only I hear 3 trillion times a movie is awful and still gather my coinTs on payday to go see it anyway. 😂
27 So far I'm the only one in the theater for #BatmanvSuperman
28 Just seen #BatmanvSuperman with @Roddersmk and I will say 10/10, @BenAffleck was awesome! Thankyou!
29 When 1 hour nap turns into 6 hours 😳 was suppose to go watch #BatmanvSuperman 😔
30 nor is casting @BenAffleck instead of Christian Bale. Or some wannabe Robert Downey Jr as Albert, but 👏🏻🙌🏻 with @GalGadot #BatmanvSuperman
31 Finally went to see #BatmanvSuperman and didn't expect much after all the critical reviews but I thought it was pretty good 👌
32 @amirkingkhan vs @Canelo #FlashvSuperman #BatmanvSuperman #KhanCanelo #CaneloKhan #TeamKhan wooohoo can't wait for May 7 #Boxing #dccomics
33 #Cosplay wish list for our new music video #BatmanvSuperman #CapvIronMan and DaredevilvPunisher @SupanovaExpo #Melbourne
34 @Ash_Undead @GraceRandolph "other people" YOU? Stop speaking for people as if you're right and ppl who liked #BatmanvSuperman are wrong.
35 #BatmanvSuperman was the best ever .lol critics are little kids
36 If the cops stop u.. Just shout out Martha!!😂😂😂 hopefully the cops won't shoot #BatmanvSuperman  #BlackLivesMartha🔥🔥😂😂
1 Finally getting to see #BatmanvSuperman with the family! #movienight #mommylife
2 Superman is my favorite,  but I don't think they understand how heroic #Batman is in this movie Jay,  @JayTowers #BatmanvSuperman
3 .@TheRealStanLee I loved the #batmanvsuperman movie a LOT! I've seen it 3x. I love Marvel as well. You CAN enjoy both. BvS was a fun ride!
4 @TheRealStanLee I've seen #BatmanvSuperman 4 times and I'm going again tomorrow. I love it!
5 Watched #BatmanvSuperman Wasn't a great movie (lots of problems here and there) but overall a decent movie.
6 My heart feels a little better seeing the reviews for #CaptainAmericaCivilWar , was worried they may do the #BatmanvSuperman to it! #TeamCap
7 @TheRealStanLee I'm just loving all of the diverse responses here, waiting for the dvd release before I watch. #BatmanvSuperman
8 Was going to see #BatmanvSuperman tonight but no one in the party - including me - could be fucked with it.
9 #BatmanvSuperman : #1 freakin round, @WonderWoman kick ass ☺♥
10 @TheRealStanLee TBH, NO desire for #BatmanvSuperman DC just isn't doing storyline &amp; character as well as @Marvel. Wonder Woman sounds 👌🏽
11 #BatmanvSuperman talk in a Marvel line, this is sacrilege.
12 If Warner Bros owns Rotten Tomatoes, why did they allow #BatmanvSuperman to get trashed?
13 #suicidesquad #CaptainAmericaCivilWar #XMenApocalypse and #DoctorStrange gotta impress after #deadpool We'll forget about #BatmanvSuperman
14 #batmanvsuperman will eclipse the average Nolan #batman box office gross soon also! #JokerWasHere
15 #BatmanvSuperman : #dawnofjustice reached a worldwide total gross of more than $800 million
16 Go see #BatmanvSuperman.  And if you are a fan of @RocksteadyGames' Arkham series &amp; their take on #TheBatman, go see this movie right now!
17 Finally saw #BatmanvSuperman and I must say it's far from bad but it could be a lot better.
18 Saw #BatmanvSuperman really liked it, Luther part not good, subtext of story could have been done better, but it was entertaining
19 I saw #BatmanvSuperman again.....AND IT'S STILL MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!! 10/10 A+ A Monumental Masterpiece🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️
20 @SuperheroFeed My suspicion that Zack Snyder truly hates us is confirmed. #BatmanvSuperman #JustSayNo
21 Fuckin wank watch @BenAffleck well unsuited for #BatmanvSuperman should of give it to Will Farrell #FBAinJax
22 @Gryfian2148  I can easly say that #BatmanvSuperman wasnt that bad loved the entry of the film but i felt like there was 10pages of dialogue
23 That popping sound you hear: WB &amp; DC execs celebrating #BatmanvSuperman passing $300 million domestically with a case of Korbel Minis.
24 @erika_myles I didn't want to say :D I was just grateful for the pic. Have you seen #BatmanvSuperman yet?
25 We're finally seeing #BatmanvSuperman. I really hope it doesn't suck as much as I expect it to.
26 @TheRealStanLee the DCEU is juuuust getting started true believer!!  More to come w/ the Justice League and Wonder Woman.  #BatmanvSuperman
27 @JaeRoar Sometimes I just sit back to myself and say "Damn did we all see the same movie? Like did we really?" #BatmanvSuperman #WasAwesome
28 @MustacheDad @GraceRandolph #BatmanvSuperman didn't even have Spidermen in it. Total bullshit. #CaptainAmericaCivilWar has Spidermen.
29 But I guess #BatmanVSuperman qualifies. There is so little going on of importance, absolutely you should be able to phonefuck 4/2
30 @GraceRandolph I'm going to click on and then link all the articles that say #BatmanvSuperman was bad and Civil War was good because it true
31 for example, I was mostly incredibly bored during #BatmanvSuperman so I even reached out for my phone for a sec, but then mid movie, a BREAK
32 @RealMarkyBangz better than #BatmanvSuperman
33 So Deadpool 2 is definitely incoming! Cannot wait oh yea and before I forget thank you #BatmanvSuperman for such a waste of time #TeamMarvel
34 #BatmanvSuperman not nearly as shite as I was led to expect. Good job, low expectations.
35 Hopefully the script for #JusticeLeague is only for like 3 hours and not like #BatmanvSuperman where the original cut was 4 hours so there's
36 #BatmanvSuperman is an epic ode to America's mythic titans. Snyder's style is sumptuous, grandiose &amp; stirring as in 300 &amp; Watchmen. 3.5/4
37 @GraceRandolph 800 millions for #BatmanvSuperman . Wow . Expecting 900 millions .,great job
38 Well I dunno what to say after sitting though #BatmanvSuperman... 😒
39 Really enjoyed #BatmanvSuperman &amp; thought Jesse Eisenberg was great as Lex Luthor @cineworld #AUL
40 Finally watched #BatmanvSuperman tonight such a good film I hope they make another one they can't let him die like that 😵😁
41 I don't understand Batman vs Superman. This is pretty dumb. #BatmanvSuperman
42 800.8 MILLION! I told someone that it'd make 800 million plus and they didn't believe me. #BatmanvSuperman #BoxOffice #JusticeLeague #DC
43 #BatmanvSuperman: Dawn of Justice was fantatic a third time round! Can't wait for all these beautiful DC movies coming out!
44 Finally seeing #BatmanvSuperman. If only the Green Arrow was in this movie they would both lose
45 I want a leather #iPhone case like the official Apple one but with the #BatmanvSuperman logo indented into it instead of the Apple logo.
46 Batman:  Tell me, do you bleed? #BatmanvSuperman
47 @PuzzDragNA @BatmanvSuperman @DCComics wow! Anime looking #BatmanvSuperman characters.
48 If there is a extended director's cut of #BatmanvSuperman please expand Lois role as much as possible.
49 @ChesterEugene @ManOfSteel37013 @GraceRandolph @andysignore Like #Watchmen and #BatmanvSuperman...
50 people trying 2 make fun of those who like #BatmanvSuperman remind me of Idiocracy, where speakin normally was "pompous and faggy" to them.
51 I think #SuicideSquad #DoctorStrange an #Deadpool will be the best movies this year... beating #CivilWar and #BatmanvSuperman easily.
52 Just saw #batmanvsuperman. What should I say? LOVED @JesseEisenberg 's performance! #LexLuthor was on another LEVEL
53 @ConfidentLEEme they complained about for #BatmanVSuperman, but reaction won't be so extreme cause 1) Marvel brand 2) expectations, smh.
1 My current goal is to catch up on enough sleep to actually be human again and do human things like watch #BatmanvSuperman again hehe. #TGIF?
2 #BatmanvSuperman is going to look so awful in contrast to #CaptainAmericaCivilWar (I mean, more than it already does).
3 @ottensam @BatmanvSuperman truly fascinating stuff,I can't wait for the Directors Cut of #BatmanvSuperman
4 #BatmanvSuperman the critics can jump off a cliff they've used up any usefulness. Cracking entertainment nice one @ZackSnyder keep em coming
5 About to watch #BatmanvSuperman again... Let's see how this goes.
6 @marringtonjamie @stuzib85 yeah some stories may be best left untold...#BatmanvSuperman
7 @LuaraLoddi They need to lighten things up just a bit.  That was the #1 critical and commercial complaint for #BatmanvSuperman.
8 Snagged me a date to see #BatmanvSuperman again before it leaves theaters 😊
9 .@empiremagazine You cannot give #HardcoreHenry one star and #BatmanvSuperman three... It's not perfect, but it was innovative fun. HH&gt;BvS
10 The reviews are coming in for #CaptainAmericaCivilWar &amp; this is the moment I've been dreading as a #DC fan since #BatmanvSuperman came out.
11 @BenAffleck I just want to say I enjoyed your version of Batman and I enjoyed the movie. Looking forward to more. #BatmanvSuperman
12 Going out with some friends. #BatmanvSuperman
13 Lex Luthor: Teach me Stephen Strange: Teach me #BatmanvSuperman #DoctorStrange
14 As usual, I'll tweet my review later tonight! #BatmanvSuperman
15 We finally get around to talking about #BatmanvSuperman! And some other stuff!
16 #BatmanvSuperman biggest flaw was Zach Snyders ability to try and be TO cinematic
17 What @ZackSnyder did with #BatmanvSuperman is reminiscent of what Stanley Kubrick did with #EyesWideShut. Completely ahead of it's time.
18 I love superhero movies! With this said, am I the only one who doesn't care for that new #BatmanvSuperman movie?
19 Taught Batman vs Superman was actually very good! Took my a while to understand what was going on though 😂 #BatmanvSuperman
20 SPOILER ALERT: the only humorous moment you will see in #BatmanvSuperman is the one you've already seen in the trailer. Ha ha ha! #gotcha
21 I thought #BatmanvSuperman was alright enough. Can't see why it's getting slated
22 I just realized that Beautiful Lie is a soft piano version of Batman's theme. #BatmanvSuperman
23 Whether you think #BatmanvSuperman is the greatest CB film or not. It's only 2nd for DCEU. #CivilWar is 13th for MCU, takes time to settle
24 If #BatmanvSuperman sucked, why compare #CivilWar to it?
25 @darththawne @ScottMendelson  FYI: if anybody has noticed But #BatmanvSuperman made a fucking load of money with almost all press against
26 Jeremy Irons is an older version of Robert Downey Jr. #BatmanvSuperman
27 Dear everybody: please keep talking about #BatmanvSuperman being garbage, it's still one of my favorite things right now
28 #deadpool is the 8th movie in a series that averages $400million box office -a number DOUBLED by #batmanvsuperman #JokerWasHere #dcrules
29 @indiewire He was good in the Batman costume, he sucked as Brice Wayne #BatmanvSuperman Bad idea whoever approved him to direct #Filmmaker
30 I haven't seen #BatmanvSuperman but from what I've heard it may have done better during Mother's Day weekend.  #Martha
31 About to watch #BatmanvSuperman hopefully it's a decent movie. I haven't heard many good reviews about it, so my expectations are pretty low
32 Who would win in this fight? #BatmanvSuperman #Marvel #DCComics
33 .@ZackSnyder to Jesse Eisenberg: Please watch a lot of @iamsrk movies because you have to act exactly like him in #BatmanvSuperman.
34 Nothing beats the experience of watching a movie in the cinema!! #BatmanvSuperman
35 Although it's DC's own fault for sandwiching #BatmanvSuperman between #DaredevilSeason2 and #CaptainAmericaCivilWar.
1 @drafthouse matinee for #BatmanvSuperman then food and drinks @voxtable then back to #Alamo for #Deadpool! #bestday @haley_hickock
2 Yeah, didnt hate that at all. #BatmanvSuperman
3 .@MasterPancake got me to see #BatmanvSuperman again in theaters, which is something I swore I wouldn't do. I'm both happy and sad.
4 I'm off to see #BatmanvSuperman. Someone wish me luck.
5 @cbgirl19 making a necklace while reviewing #BatmanvSuperman is the highlight of my day.
6 When a movie makes nearly a billion dollars in 1 month, media types can't nitpick WB when they say "BvS is a monster." #BatmanvSuperman
7 He's getting what seems like the only universal praise out of #BatmanvSuperman so I'd love to see his vision of the character and the movie.
8 @ColliderNews @ColliderVideo haven't seen #BatmanvSuperman yet so I guess Batman lives
9 I think the one really great thing that came out of #BatmanvSuperman was that Ben showed us he actually  can be the Batman we deserve.
10 I would go see #BatmanvSuperman rated R in theaters.
11 #BatmanvSuperman @BenAffleck nailed Batman best Batman since Keaton, Nolan's trilogy is very much over-rated give Ben his due!
12 Luckily I only spent $6.00 on the movie ticket, but #BatmanvSuperman was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.... simply terrible. #FAIL
13 I missed the Riddler Easter egg in #BatmanvSuperman
14 @wbpictures @WarnerBrosEnt @ZackSnyder @DCComics #RratedBatmanvSuperman put it in the theater, give it an intermission #BatmanvSuperman
15 @RuhGEEnah Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman in #BatmanVSuperman &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
16 Give me another @ZackSnyder &amp; Henry Cavill solo #Superman film. @BATMANONFILM #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice #WhoCaresAboutJusticeLeague
17 I am genuinely worn on BatFilms. That said. I will watch BatFleck and IronsAlfred. They killed it in the #BatmanvSuperman crapfest.
18 #LRT Sounds good to me. Affleck did the role of Batman justice in #BatmanvSuperman.
19 Now that #batmanvsuperman has made$800million #marveltard losers wanna talk about profits and return on investment. #gfy
20 Loved #BatmanvSuperman loved #WonderWoman loved being able to have lengthy talks about a superhero film not since #ManofSteel &amp; last #Batman
21 #BatmanvSuperman was so good ! The ending pissed me off
22 Warner Bros. really wants #CinemaCon2016 to know #BatmanVSuperman was a "big success." Doth protest...
23 Finally saw #BatmanvSuperman what a cracking film! That's another for the blue ray collection!
24 #BatmanvSuperman was so much better than I was advised and expected.. 😍👊🏽
25 Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman kicked fucking ASS - everyone who hated her can go suck it #WonderWoman #bvs #BatmanvSuperman
26 There should be no celebrating such a trash film. #BatmanvSuperman
27 .@BenAffleck &amp; Amy Adams take the stage at CinemaCon to celebrate #BatmanvSuperman
28 What if #superman is a blue eyed #middleeastern man @DCComics after all his creators are Jewish... Hmmm #BatmanvSuperman
29 @LaurenCimorelli #BatmanvSuperman  when is the best??
30 At the #movie #BatmanvSuperman just for #ezramiller #theflash scenes .. 😊😊
31 Saw #Deadpool &amp; #BatmanvSuperman today both good movies
32 @RealRonHoward @RealHansZimmer @tomhanks looks like great work. Hans really did a great job on #BatmanvSuperman great score on 2nd viewing
33 @WarnerBrosEnt @BatmanvSuperman Or be none of it. You don't owe this world a thing. You never did.#BatmanvSuperman
34 Don't forget we have 4 great movies around 11pm tonight for just $5! #BatmanvSuperman @TheBossFilm @HardcoreHenry &amp; @eyeintheskyfilm !!
35 So how is #Darkseid not gonna come off like a #Thanos knock-off?  . . #musings #TheAvengers #BatmanVSuperman #Marvel @DragoNYC
36 anyone else think it was weird that Commissioner Gordon didn't show up in #BatmanvSuperman? #sooperdooperheroes
37 Good to know that Bruce and Kent were Mamas boys at heart! #BatmanvSuperman oh Martha!
38 Great start down the #JusticeLeague Road, love @BenAffleck take on Batman, recommend #BatmanvSuperman
39 #BatmanVSuperman !!!! Al fiiin :D
40 People boost up superhero movies about characters they barely know and crap on #BatmanvSuperman because of preconceptions.  Sad and stupid.
41 Never mind #BatmanvSuperman. I want to see a Morgan v. Carol (with Mike) action movie. #TWD #BetterCallSaul #TheWalkingDead @hardwick
42 Whatever the reviews said for #BatmanvSuperman fuck 'em it's an amazing movie, go and see it!
43 #BatmanvSuperman  Should be Called The Return of lois lane Movie with supporting cast Superman &amp; Batman with lex , Wonderwoman thrown in lol
44 Why did #BatmanvSuperman feel the need to Nolanize Lex Luthor's baldness? Why did he need a dark/gritty reason to become bald?
45 So #BatmanvSuperman is absolutely atrocious. 🙃🙃🙃
46 Why do I never care about stuff the rest of the country is into--like #BatmanVSuperman and “taking care of your personal health”? #Outcast
47 #BatmanvSuperman  has the best freaking ever like you not gone even  see it coming
48 I enjoyed #BatmanvSuperman tbh Though I do think Lois Lane was pretty useless
49 #BatmanvSuperman 😍😍 I actually understood it and OMG @BenAffleck I LOVE YOU!!!! Such a sexy man!!! #
50 I'm enjoying  "Superman Homepage - "Radio KAL""  on Podcast Lounge for Windows Phone! @SupermanHomepge #BatmanvSuperman
51 Just started listening to my @vokpodcast peeps' episode on #BatmanvSuperman, and @F_T_Ward's spoiler warning has me giggling on the subway.
52 2nd viewing of #BatmanVSuperman tonight. Think I enjoyed it even more than the 1st. Absolutely fantastic!
53 Who is the next director you'd put in charge of #Superman? #BatmanvSuperman #DawnofJustice #ManofSteel
54 @gohollywoodorg @flavorwire c'mon, #BatmanvSuperman is anything but a disappointment.
55 @GraceRandolph Maybe everyone that didn't like #BatmanvSuperman didn't see it in Dolby?
