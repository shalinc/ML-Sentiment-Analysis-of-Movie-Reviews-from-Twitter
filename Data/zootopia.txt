9 Finally saw #Zootopia 😊
10 Surely I'm not the only one who caught the @BreakingBad_AMC  joke in @DisneyZootopia #kidsmovie #Zootopia #BreakingBad #inappropiate ?? Haha
11 Went and saw #Zootopia last night, thought it was better than Frozen and I actually almost teared up at points. #imnotashamed
12 Reviewing all the #Zootopia wolves doodle by @arashi_takemoto made me few empty and lonely and sad. 😔 #howls
13 Just went to see Zootopia! IT WAS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!  10/10 #Zootopia
14 I wonder if #Zootopia will end up with a higher domestic box office than #BatmanvSuperman. Currently, $3M lower, but holding up better.
15 Zootopia! One of my favorite movies!!! 💗🙌🏻 #zootopia
16 I'm off to the Drive In theater! It's opening weekend, and a double feature as always. #JungleBook #Zootopia
17 If #furries are people that like anthro' animals, #Zootopia then what are people called that like anthro' food? Munchies? #SausagePartyMovie
18 Took the cousin to see #Zootopia and I Loved it  #Oscarwinner
19 I love you guys. #zootopia
20 Only a Disney movie would make me ship a fox and a bunny. #Zootopia #MovieWithTheKids
21 I'm watching #Zootopia in case anyone was interested. #moviedaywithdad #mydadiscoolerthanyourdad
22 For those who have seen int'l and non-English versions of #Zootopia, does Judy still read the Miranda rights to Lionheart at Cliffside?
23 Bateman shines in #Zootopia wonderful film!
24 Finally saw #Zootopia with the kid. What a wonderful movie with a timeless message.
25 Having 9 year old brother is great cause I still get to go to kids movies without it being weird! #zootopia
26 That little rabbit from Zootopia was so cute &lt;3 #judyhopps #Zootopia
27 The G is on babysitter duty today.  #Zootopia
28 Zootopia was fantastic! The message is more relevant than ever right now. Loved it! #Zootopia
29 Just watched #Zootopia / #Zootropolis and I must say I'm in love with the main characters, specially with Nick😻  A very inspirational movie!
30 No shame in my Disney game #Zootopia #disney #movies
31 Had a great day at the movies with my best friend! Go out and see #Zootopia if you get a chance
32 @JuliaHoffe @ByronPHoward Check the DMV for openings #Zootopia
33 Finally was able to watch #Zootopia and it was much better than I thought. Plus, my two favorite animals were the main characters! :D
34 Highlight of my weekend is about to be this bottomless bucket of popcorn tonight tbh #zootopia
35 Tbh the only reason I came to Disney California adventure is to take a picture with Nick and Judy ❤️ #zootopia
36 #Zootopia finally reached 300 Million  Domestically. I'm worried again for it slowing down...
37 Just saw @DisneyZootopia and it was amazing! Highly recommend! #Zootopia #Disney
38 @_rich_moore @ByronPHoward Guys, do you know when we can expect #Zootopia to come out on Blu Ray / Digital / DVD? Will it get extra content?
39 *g* The word #Zootopia fits into the old hippie song, Aquarius. Did a Pop/EDM parody — check my Dreamsong FA if UR hip to the jive!
40 Zootopia was fun to see! It's a wonderful movie filled with gorgeous environments, delightful characters, and topnotch story! #Zootopia
41 #Hollywood_News: ZOOTOPIA earned an estimated $2.14M on Friday. Domestic total is now $301.4M. #Zootopia
42 Back from seeing #Zootropolis - that sloth scene was hilarious! 😂 P.S. @mariongnd no mention of #Zootopia anywhere!!
1 #Zootopia also includes the common trope of hick-farmer parents, preaching their practical wisdom &amp; traditions, which are but dust before..
2 Gonna watch #Zootopia in a bit...
3 Finally seeing #Zootopia tonight!!! 🐰
4 This is certainly *not* my sixth time seeing #Zootopia,  and not the first time it hasn't been packed. :P
5 @Simbayo You can't just touch an alpaca's wool like that! #zootopia
6 Noticed that! (Also had to explain it to 14yo.) RT @AldereteMary Clever nod to Breaking Bad in #Zootopia!
7 Just went to see #Zootopia with Becca. Stunningly beautiful film 💙
8 Going to go see #zootopia !!!
9 #Zootopia was SO good. Long live the animal kingdom.
10 Tomorrow is #MovieTown day, let's watch #Zootopia together! 😀💖💻💺🍚😋
11 Well, I'm convinced Disney's hit a Renaissance, now I just need to fit seeing #Zootopia into my schedule. :)
12 I won't give up, no, I won't give in 'Til I reach the end, then I'll start again #zootopia #shakira #tryeverything
13 Saw #Zootopia. Can't stop singing "Try Everything" now 😄 🎵I won't give up no I won't give in Til I reach the end and then I'll start again🎵
14 Headed to see #Zootopia tonight! #wdw #disney
15 Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny "cute," but when other animals do it, that's a little... #zootopia
16 Finally got to see #Zootopia! 🙌🤗
17 Clever nod to Breaking Bad in #Zootopia!
18 @ByronPHoward where Can I buy it I want it!!! Tell me where and I'll waste all my money !! 😂😂😂🤑🤑💵💵 #Zootopia Zootropolis!!
19 It's a good thing we had the whole theatre to ourselves today! Jacob giggled through that entire movie! 😂 #Zootopia
20 About to spend $60 to take a nap. It'll be worth it. #zootopia
21 That’s it for another week. Stay safe, #Zootopia. Enjoy your weekend and avoid the chupacabras!  “Trust - Integrity - Bravery”
22 #cat carsofinstagram Some new things added! One made up character on the left :3 kitty Icecream haha.  #kitty #cat #zootopia #splatoo...
23 Just saw #Zootropolis #Zootopia for the second time! Still brilliant! There are so many easter eggs to spot! :)
24 @KailLowry  I heard zootopia is really good and funny for kids. My oldest daughter saw it and ❤️Ed it. #zootopia
25 I just wanna see Zootopia again. And again. #Zootopia
26 Just watched #Zootropolis and the sloth-loving @IMKristenBell is voicing a sloth. #genius #Zootopia #yesilovewatchingkidsmovies
27 @AlyssaBeCrazy @ThatCybertGuy so what did you think of #Zootopia?!
28 With #TheJungleBook on the heels of #Zootopia, #Disney has certainly out-Mickey Moused itself as king of the talking animals movie jungle.
29 Watched #Zootopia a second time today. It's so much fun watching it and 'Try Everything' is such a perfect good-mood-song 💞💞💞
30 ZOOTOPIA took in $0.669M on Thursday and has grossed $299.24M to date domestically. #Zootopia
31 Today #Zootopia cracks $300M domestic mark. Only 5th original toon to ever do it after LionKing, FindingNemo, Frozen &amp; InsideOut.
32 Should I see #Zootopia or #TheJungleBook first today?
33 At my museum’s fundraiser there was the Bogo family. Funny, I didn’t see the #Zootopia chief of police there.
34 Disappointed @EricLaValle didn't take the twins to see #ZOOTOPIA
35 Surprised to learn that #Zootopia was released as #Zootropolis in the UK, which... I actually think is a better name. Huh.
36 @SlackHQ Did you guys really make a commercial based of @DisneyZootopia #Zootopia #Disney #Um
37 @GraceRandolph what's up with Disney's #Moana? The most I've seen from that movie was its cameo in #Zootopia. Is #Disney having cold feet?
38 So can #zootopia come out on Blu-Ray now or...?
39 Still out in cinemas: the absolutely charming animation #Zootropolis #Zootopia Not just for kids! @Disney
40 #Zootopia is Absolutely Brilliant :) Wife and 6yo saw it weeks ago.  Daughter now asking how to about become a cop. *wince #CarrotFarmer
41 Can't believe they had basically a meth lab and two characters called Walter and Jessie 😂 #Zootopia
1 I won't give up, I won't give in, until I reach the end and then I'll start again #shakira #zootopia #mustwatch #dancingtigers #motivation
2 Trying to debate what to go see tonight #Zootopia or #BarberShopTheNextCut  #decisionsdecisionsdecisions
3 Going to see @DisneyZootopia again!! So excited! ❤🐰 @DisneyStudios #zootopia #JudyHopps #NickWilde @batemanjason
4 @_rich_moore I've seen #Zootopia for 5th time on the last screening in 🇲🇽! Now let's wait for Digital / DVD / Blu Ray! #AchievementUnlocked
5 Just because I had a crush on Disney’s Robin Hood back in the day doesn’t mean I can be seduced by #Zootopia shipping! That’s just…wrong!
6 @ByronPHoward It looks so cute 😍😍😍😍🐾🐾#Zootopia #Zootropolis @DisneyZootopia
7 Zootopia sloths are my new penguins of Madagascar. 11/10 #favoritecharacters #zootopia #disney
8 You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the academy. #zootopia
9 Just realized the best thing about #Zootopia it means "Let it Go" has been replaced by a good song
10 Thank you for tuning in, everyone. Stay safe, #Zootopia. Good night.  “Trust - Integrity - Bravery”
11 Totally in love with #TryEverything, the new song by @shakira. #Disney #Zootopia #Gazelle
12 I really want a picture with Nick and Judy #Zootopia
13 @mashable @DebNemeth Interested to know the result for #Zootopia Plenty of diversity analogy, not sure m/f balance was there
14 @people Damn, I can't even get one #Zootopia sequel announced and we still gotta wait 3 more years for #Incredibles2 like.......
15 if you haven't seen zootopia yet GO SEE IT. Well worth it.#zootopia
16 Peace is a very fragile thing. Smart yourself before jumping to conclusion. Often it's just more complicated than easy blame #Zootopia
17 #Zootopia is still playing in theaters where I live,  and I might go watch it a second time.
18 @oopsmady Hi Madison. Yes! You can find our #Zootopia mugs at Award Wieners.
19 Saw #Zootopia the other day and it was utterly adorable.
20 Still mentally fangirling about the wonderfulness that is #Zootopia. So well done!!!
21 (The few theatres remaining playing #Zootopia in 3D is selling $15+!! Glad my first viewing was in 3D… still I wanna see it again in 3D 🐺🐾🐰)
22 SO I SAW ZOOTOPIA 2 DAYS AGO, HONESTLY CAN SAY THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST DISNEY MOVIES EVER PRODUCED! WELL WORTH THE WATCH! #Zootopia #love
23 Thank you for your leadership @MyeZOO!! #Zootopia #Zootropolis #ZooOnTour
24 ZOOTOPIA took in $0.725M on Wednesday and has grossed $298.57M to date domestically. #Zootopia
25 I think master Liu Bei will love watching #Zootopia with his two sworn brothers Z.Fei and G.Yu
26 DW: Zooooooooooooooooootopia! Waaaaaaah. AMAZING!😍😍🔫🔪💉💊💣  #Zootopia
27 @Moosseff @NintendoAmerica @GameStop Calling out all furries? Well that worked well for #Zootopia
28 Did anyone see #Zootopia? That sloth working at the DMV? Take that sloth and a Kardashian- that's how slow my mom talks when I call.
29 #Zootopia playing TODAY at  12:30, 3:00, 5:15, and 7:30pm!
30 #Zootopia was  actually surprisingly good movie would be frozen not sure about that but it's really good
31 2 of my favorite movies this year are animal-centric: #Zootopia &amp; #TheJungleBook
32 @silverfox5213 Wow. #Zootopia is a place where dreams go to die.
33 watching #Zootopia
34 @silverfox5213 a slightly dark imaginative back story of Duke Weaselton from Zootopia. #zootopia #fanart #weaselton
35 Niiiiiiiiiick - Flash #Zootopia
36 "We may be evolved, but deep down we are still animals." #Zootopia
37 @OchotonidKnight Tagging this #Zootopia for later reference.
38 @Disney_Zootopia @Evilsquirrel123 #Zootopia #Zootropolis #Zootopie #Zoomania #FanArt that last one's a young Father from Fullmetal
39 Judy Hopps: Hello! I'm here to ask you some questions about a case. Nick Wilde: Then they should've gotta a real cop to solve it. #Zootopia
40 You can apply for a #Zootopia license. I just applied for mine with @zootopialicense  I'm a fox in the Rainforest District!
41 I finally got to see #Zootopia and I really loved it!
42 @_rich_moore were the neighbors based on ones you or @ByronPHoward had or were you that kind of neighbor once? #Zootopia
43 @Kyyanno I spent more on #Zootopia cinema tickets and merch last month than I did on 3 orders of #RaspberyPi3 stuff ;)
44 Does anyone know what Nick and Judy's identification codes are? #FunkoMysteryMinis #Zootopia #Disney #BlindBags
45 I really love watching movie, and the best movie in this year (till today) are: @DisneyZootopia. Because i really loved animation #Zootopia.
46 In many ways a zoo is, in fact, not a utopia. #Zootopia
47 Why don't cinemas extend "kids" films show times after 7pm? Adults would watch these films too! #Zootopia #Zootropolis
48 Is it weird to ship a fox and a bunny though? Cause that could be the theme if the movie gets a sequel! #Zootopia
49 It was so much fun tonight😳😻🖖 #Zootopia was awesome😂
50 @Disney Take notes of the success of #Zootopia / #Zootropolis and concentrate on creating further original *animated* content instead 🐭
51 A lot of animated anthropomorphised animal movies in 2016: #KungFuPanda3 #Zootopia #AngryBirds #SecretLifeOfPets #IceAge5 #FindingDory #Sing
52 Hang time tonight with my bro, watched #Zootopia ... too fun, loved it!🐰🐯🐗🐷🐭🐾🐾🐾🐾#brotime
53 Finally watched inside out. #Zootopia is way better
54 #Zootopia  is my new favorite movie 😍❤️☺️
55 @DisneyZootopia you know what's better than #Zootopia? #zootopia, In 3D 60fps.  Why can't you just do it Disney?
56 Finally had the chance to go out and see #Zootopia. I absolutely loved the movie and all of the positive messages in it.
57 I want to someday also see a live action version of #Zootopia
1 @JodieSweetin your moves were flawless on #dtws You are my favorite! #tryeverything #zootopia
2 @rabidrabbit56 we're now officially in the furry trash club... #Zootopia
3 @otaku_kouhai sure! Anything #Zootopia-themed should count :)
4 Electric reclining leather seats and no sticky floors? This theater is dope!  @RegalMovies #Zootopia
5 @MorgansWildRide it's a trend in movies in general to just recycle films. I really wish we could get good original films like #zootopia
6 I'm about to see #Zootopia for the 5th time. I think it's safe to say that I'm obsessed with this movie. 🐰🐺
7 #NewYorkCity: Population 8 million.             7pm showing of #Zootopia: Population #me.
8 He's like "Sooooo sooooft....." LMAO!!!! I made my hair look like the sheep's wool this morning.  Cosplay anyone?! #naturalhair #Zootopia
9 You wanna be an elephant when you grow up? You be an elephant. Because THIS is Zootopia. Anyone can be anything. #zootopia

15 #Zootropolis #Zootopia Loved it! #disney
16 Let's talk #Zootropolis (or #Zootopia in US) then. Incredible film and on a par with Inside Out...until the 'Night Howler' is revealed.
17 @ByronPHoward @_rich_moore What US city leads in #Zootopia revenue?
18 #Zootopia x #Aceattorneyt crossover. Make it happen.
19 At day’s end, here. Stay safe, #Zootopia. Good night and good luck.  “Trust - Integrity - Bravery”
20 @TRaguse I don't know what I like more... That you were cool enough to take them all to #Zootopia or that the theater is named Gopher. ;)
21 @shakira I can't stop listening too your new song. Evetyone must LOVE you. Disney made a GREAT choice 4 you as Gazelle. #Zootopia
22 I saw #Zootopia the other night and it was so funny! #Disney never fails to produce awesome movies.
23 That movie was pure greatness!! #Zootopia  Watch &amp; you might learn sumfn
24 You nailed it's fun kill it again on @DancingABC @JodieSweetin #Zootopia @MatthewMcCord4
25 Idris Elba voices three Disney characters this year: Chief Bogo in #Zootopia, Shere Khan in #TheJungleBook, and Fluke in #FindingDory.
26 AHHHH! #Zootopia/#Zootropolis was amazing. But what do you expect from Disney. I love Nick Wild, he was a fantastic character!
27 Saw #Zootopia. Easily-digestible anti-racism/anti-xenophobia message wrapped in a great movie. Wonder what #Trump supporters think of it...
28 That moment when you realized the "what's a camel with three humps? Pregnant!" joke from #Zootopia was ... also an adult joke ...  #HumpDay
29 #Zootopia was so good, omg!
30 Between #Zootopia and #Undertale there is lots of great stuff to replace my #PitchPerfect2 obsession.   But it won't.
31 oh yeah i forgot to mention that i saw #zootopia at a second run theater this week. i thought it was rly good!
32 @MRodOfficial What about Shakira's song "Try everything"? It is perfect! #Zootopia
33 ZOOTOPIA took in $1.06M on Tuesday and has grossed $297.85M to date domestic.  #Hollywood @DisneyZootopia  #Zootopia

36 I van say it nos : #Zootopia is sooooo awesome !!!! :DDD
37 #Zootopia is the highest-grossing film of 2016,and one of the best-reviewed,yet I hardly know a person who's seen it. I highly recommend it!
38 And they DID. They did stand out ⭐️ it's happy that their hard work was paid off ;) #Zootopia
39 Speeding sloth whoa XDDD #Zootopia &lt;3
40 @DisneyZootopia @DisneyStudios It was such an Amazing movie to be honest #Zootopia

43 @marcandreyko i want to see it again to catch all the details in the design. the rewatchability factor is high with this one. #Zootopia
44 "It's called a hustle sweetheart." :P #Zootopia #NickWilde
45 You know why Ginny wasn't as busy on OUAT, because she was busy with #Zootopia ...
46 Today, my @onemedical doctor: "So you're into Disney, right? Did you see #Zootopia?" So great when they remember these important things :-D
47 Try Everything is catchy #Zootopia
48 @BicAndMoleskine Thought of seeing #Zootopia again but I'd want a Predator v Prey bloodbath. So, not.
49 I went to renew my #Zootopia driver's license…not holding my breath on how long it will take the DMV sloths to get me it 🐰🐾🐺 @cosmicpudding
50 Wonderful Wednesday! Join us for #TheBoss #BatmanVSuperman #Zootopia #MyBigFatGreekWedding2
1 Alot of Pleople Asked me. Why are there so many Foxes in your timeline? Well I love 'em specialy Nick Wilde! So there! #Zootopia
2 Donald Trump might be president and Disney made a movie about Racism. #SignsOfTheApocalypse #Zootopia
3 Took my mob &amp; 3 others to #Zootopia yest. An interesting take on diversity with funny moments. Would love to know @SmartBitches opinion
4 Two years sober. Taking myself to a movie. #treatyoself #sober #soberlife #Zootopia
5 Going to a movie by myself for the first time while I wait on @ewieberg to land. It's awkward, but I like it. #Zootopia
6 @DisneyZootopia what a great 1st flick 4my 4year old.  Gr8 #story &amp; Judy's eyes R a supercool colour 2 :-) #awesome #Zootopia
7 Official class screening of #Zootopia! I'm expecting some exciting live tweeting from @nerdymormon, @jaclynlandeen, and @Rutherford_4_9!
8 Just saw #Zootopia. Cried the entire time. Perfect film about #perseverance #hardwork and #equality
9 Nick and Judy don't do autographs per orders of Chief Bogo. Interesting. #Zootopia
10 I'm going to watch #Zootopia #CineplexOdeon @CineplexMovies @SCENECard
11 #Zootopia is one of the best all around films I've seen in a long time!! Well done, Disney!
12 The problem with going to see kids movies in the theatre is all of the kids. #zootopia #$5tuesdays
13 I wanna try everything, I wanna try even though I could fail 👊🏽  #Zootopia #TryEverything #Shakira
14 Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny "cute," but when other animals do it, that's a little... #zootopia
15 Gonna see #Zootopia wth Mah boo 💕✨ @vulpineCaptain
16 #Zootopia Just only got $740 Thousand yesterday... Come on, people! Watch this fantastic movie!
17 #Zootopia #Zootropolis was amazing!!! @DisneyStudios smashed it!!
18 Hello everyone ! ^,^  #Zootopia
19 Are there sentient anthropomorphic bats in #Zootopia @_rich_moore
20 Lowkey crushing on Nick Wilde from #zootopia / #zootropolis guess you could say he's a FOXY character amirite lads 🔥🔥🔥
21 Just seen #Zootopia with my OH - it may be an animated film but we really enjoyed it! :)
22 Welsh @UKIPWales leader obviously seen #Zootopia, answer a question with your own and then answer that instead
23 Sloth, my new favourite animal :). Watch #Zootopia :D
24 Went through Walmart and saw so much #zootopia merchandise for sale. Should have made the song "Buy Everything" #dancingtigers #wouldbuy
25 #Zootopia is INCREDIBLE!!!
26 Took the kids to see #Zootopia. It was great! Not sure where my kids wound up. I was pretty into the movie. If you see 'em, you know...call.
27 Was pretty disappointed that #Zootopia poked fun at larger bodies, so there's still work to be done.
28 Another day in the world’s greatest city comes to an end. Stay safe, #Zootopia. Good night.  “Trust - Integrity - Bravery”
29 People who claim to be progressive and then go and judge others. Y'all need to go see #Zootopia and learn a lesson from #Disney.
30 Also... Goes without saying, I loved Jodie Sweetin's Zootopia number! #DWTS #DisneyNight #Zootopia #TeamMoSweet
31 @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN would one of them happen to be #Zootropolis / #Zootopia ? I think the politics of animal life would interest you.
32 #Zootropolis/#Zootopia very good for a kids film. Was a tad predictable. But good. 8/10
33 I've never bought myself a DVD before, or had a BluRay disk, or player, or 3DTV. But that #ZooTopia 3D BR/DVD is as good as mine. #Furries
34 @SNSwithJKJ wait!  You haven't seen #Zootopia yet?  You guys, it's so awesome. I saw it alone,then took my wife to see it. She loved it
35 For the first time in almost 7 years of living in a building attached to a movie theatre, I am at a movie by myself. #zootopia #cantwait
36 #dmv in NYC is just like #Zootopia
37 Soo #Zootropolis / #Zootopia  was great! Really enjoyed that one :)
38 Those dancing tigers are everything #Zootopia
39 #Zootropolis #Zootopia  = amazing!! Incredible animation, with such a lovely message and great character relationships. Seriously great film
40 @ObabScribbler #BigHero6, The Fox and the Hound, and #Zootopia.
41 TV at dmv was showing commercial with sloth #DMV scene from #Zootopia. Someone noticed and quickly changed the channel. #bureaucrazy
42 Zootopia was a funny movie. My family &amp; I enjoyed it. The sloths were the highlight for me! Lol #Zootopia #sloth #funny 😂
43 ZOOTOPIA took in $0.782M on Monday and has grossed $296.79M to date domestically. #Zootopia
44 @_rich_moore gah! I can't wait no longer! may I buy my Blu Ray copy of #Zootopia early? :o

46 Taking Alina to the movies cause I won't be able to in a while. 😫😖😭 were watching #Zootopia and I'm the only one with an actual kid LOL
47 @wickanne @GiselleEvns Do not hire sloths to work at the DMV. #Zootopia
48 Being rejected by the cool kids is often the best thing that could happen to you. Forge your own path. #zootopia
49 I love how #Zootopia is low key making a social commentary on racism, homophobia, and sexism in American society #greatmovie
50 @spnbunnies It's a great movie, isn't it?  #TryEverything #Zootopia #BeMoreBun
51 @PappyKorn I just saw that movie with my son over the weekend... Great movie! #Zootopia #racism
52 @CorranFox #DWTS #Zootopia all my likes
53 a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when other animals do it it's a little... #Zootopia #racism
54 So my mom was watching #DWTS last night &amp; one of the couples danced to Shakira's song "Try Everything" from #Zootopia :D
55 #weekend #boxoffice  1. #TheBoss ($23.5 Million) 2. #BatmanvSuperman ($23.3 Million) 3. #Zootopia ($14.3 Million)

64 @ByronPHoward I love the movie! Great work! Will the spoof posters ever be sold officially? #Zootopia
65 @NineLeavez @RevitFur @furrynewsntwk True, and I genuinly think #Zootopia is going to boost numbers for 2016/17
