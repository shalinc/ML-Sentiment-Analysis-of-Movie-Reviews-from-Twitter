54 I hope after @TheJungleBook's success they take the whole cast &amp; crew &amp; make a #TaleSpin film! #JungleBook #BillMurray #JonFavreau @Disney
55 #JungleBook is one of the finest 3D movies you would come across
56 @hoyitsandrew @CinemasCineplex @CineplexMovies Is Shere Khan running the Cineplex website? #JungleBook
57 @SijuMoothedath Mowgli has to take his wolf family along with him to watch #JungleBook movie (because it is rated U/A)
58 First @cinemasins did Jungle Book, then @screenjunkies' #HonestTrailers, and then @TheHISHEdotcom. I'm guessing #JungleBook is coming out!
59 Loving #JungleBook. Great casting and voice acting and even with the modern visuals the film still retains its charm and soul.
60 Oh My God #JungleBook !! SPECTACULAR :)  @Jon_Favreau you are brilliant.  I am super curious about how it's dubbed in hindi as well. Soooon!
61 @michielams @GuardianBooks thank you so much! It was a wonderful piece to illustrate #JungleBook
62 #JungleBook The Movie ! Had a Quick Rewind through Childhood Memories . But not so exciting 3D effects. #LatestMovie #MovieCritic
63 @CaitOConner I'm going to think of this tweet and #JungleBook the next time someone orders chai tea.
64 Saw @TheJungleBook today.  Enjoyed it! #Nostalgia #JungleBook   Great work by @TheNeelSethi, @idriselba, #BillMurray &amp; others. #Mowgli
65 @Jon_Favreau took me back to my childhood. #JungleBook was full of heart and charm! Role of CGI in live action films has been redefined.
66 Really want to go see #junglebook it looks hard
67 We had a BLAST at #AcrossThePond and would like to thank everyone for coming, and our sponsor #JungleBook #JungleBookNU #NU. #acappella
68 Hoping @reyes_annabel will take me on a date to see #JungleBook 🐅🐆🐘
69 Droppin' some #JungleBook knowledge today, re: Baloo really just means bear, Shere is tiger, et al.
70 Favourite line from #JungleBook - Baloo to Pangolin: This is the most #threatened you'll ever be. @IUCNRedList
71 So it's #JungleBook this week and #GoTSeason6 next week.. Whoop whoop
It is a very bad and disgusting movie
