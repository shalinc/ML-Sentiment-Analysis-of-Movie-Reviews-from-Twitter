22 Hahahahaha, quand #Deadpool joue à Kanto Classic has arrived in Canada as much as the chances that was you grew up for over
23 Kids here playing #Avengers. One, about 4, says "I'm deadpool". What sort of parent lets a 4 year old watch #Deadpool? #BadParenting
24 @VancityReynolds &amp; @blakelively expecting baby 2. This just proves my theory loving #deadpool as much as I do will get you pregnant
25 Sarcasm is life. Sarcasm is love. #deadpool
26 #Deadpool sequel coming 😃 hope bigger budget and more #Xmen in it. &amp; #Colossus the actor from @XMenMovies and not a CGI Russian!!
27 Is it just me or is @VancityReynolds the most hilarious guy ever 😂 #Deadpool
28 There's some bad films about at the minute, don't bother with #BatmanvSuperman #FinestHours #TheGodOfEgypt #Pandemic or #Deadpool all 💩💤
29 Fake laughing! Hiding real pain. #Deadpool
30 seeing #Deadpool for a second time

32 finally I saw #Deadpool ❤
33 Watching #Deadpool #Afdah 😎
34 Tive a ver #Deadpool
35 You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl - #facts #deadpool
36 The mask and deadpool have alot of similarites and #Mask was way better than #Deadpool
37 Yeah I thought #Deadpool was a superhero movie! The guy is fucking super but he's no hero!. So miraculous
38 If #Deadpool had read #Wonder, he might have decided to #choosekind instead of killing everyone. Granted that's a diff movie. #booknerds
39 .@discolando @RobertsSpaceInd You #BuriedTheLede: The French #StarCitizen broadcast co-starred #Deadpool! ;-)
40 I'm touching myself tonight #couldntresist #Deadpool
41 And now settling in for some serious fangirling.  Again. #deadpool #fangirl #happybug
42 You are haunting. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado. #Deadpool
43 #DeadPool whaaaaaat 😱😱😱😱
44 #A1Film Analysis @DeadPoolMovie #BradPitt + #CharlesGrodin equals  @VancityReynolds + @SpiderManMovie = #Deadpool amends for @WolverineMovie

50 I would love to see #thePunisher Vs #deadpool
51 @VancityReynolds @Deadpool @marvel how do we bring #Deadpool to the stage? #makeithappen #wewantin #mercwithamouth
52 Surprisingly like #deadpool, the fact that @VancityReynolds is the main character in it might have something to do with it...😏

17 "Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness" #deadpool
18 The best parts of #HouseOfCards are when Frank Underwood breaks the fourth wall and goes all #Deadpool
19 "Love is blind, Wade." "No. You're blind." #Deadpool

35 #Deadpool a bit like sitting through half an hour of Tim Vine - Hard work!
36 Omg I had a dream I was having some bomb ass sex with #Deadpool!!! #truestory 😲
37 #Deadpool :Where's Francis!!??!!  #Batman :why did you say that name?!?!? (yelling in batman voice)  . . .this conversation would never end
38 My violent and humorous side just wants to watch #Deadpool &amp; #Suicideclub and my whole other wants to cuddle and discuss world peace. 😪
39 Deadpool is one of the best and funniest films I've watched and Ryan Reynolds just makes it even better. 😂😂 #Deadpool 🔴
40 @TechnoBuffalo is it supposed to look like #deadpool went through a hot wash with some funky socks.
41 @anDrew_A_Blank @sulamoon @Uptomyknees The first who does will realise the opportunity that's been missed all this time. like R #Deadpool
42 @VancityReynolds please name your new baby Francis, it works either way. #Deadpool
43 Deadpool was proper hilarious😂😂😂 #Deadpool #Action
44 @Michael5SOS !!! DEADPOOL 2 IS CONFIRMED 😤😤😤. WE CAN RESERVE OUR TICKETS SOON! LET'S GO TOGETHER!!! #5SOS #5SOSFAM #Deadpool

55 Changing my middle name from Francis to Ajax.  Thank you #Deadpool #ajax
56 @JoeRaineri I'll take #Johnnyfootball #johnnymanziel in the #Deadpool for $100
57 I miss #Deadpool 😭😭😭😭😭 #AngelOfTheMorning #CarelessWhisper #SexyMotherfucker
58 Baffles me people call Deadpool a ground breaking movie. Outside of its success as an R-Rated flick, what makes it so special? #deadpool
59 I think doctor visits are the perfect time to break out my #Deadpool shirts. I always wonder if they get the humor in it.
60 Finally got to see Deadpool, and it definitely did NOT disappoint 😊#deadpool
61 @ThisIsFusion I have personally been yelled at during a movie for having my "screen glow" disrupting #Deadpool but the woman was ugly
62 @VancityReynolds i heard spiderman was wanted for deadpool 2, is there a chance Fox can use "the bombastic bagman"? #SpiderMan #Deadpool
63 #Deadpool2 #Deadpool is back again😍😍😍😍😍
1 Woah first #Deadpool as an R rated super hero flick but now DC #BatmanTheKillingJoke is 1st animated superhero title thats R rated
2 @jdmorganinfo should play Cable in #Deadpool 2. Just my two cents that nobody asked for. @cbgirl19 who would you pick?
3 Yeah! #Deadpool 2 coming soon!
4 Why am I underage for this awesome movie?😢 #Deadpool
5 Why is everyone acting so surprised by the #Deadpool 2 announcement? They basically announced it at the end of the movie, so...? Idk.
6 my big rubber masterbating shoes #crocs #deadpool @Crocs
7 I'm touching myself tonight 👉👌🙈😂 #Deadpool  💀💩L
8 @VancityReynolds finally watched #Deadpool and unlike #batmanvssuperman I was far from disappointed. #bringonasequel
9 Deadpool 2 confirmed this should be good! First one was too good!! #Deadpool2 #deadpool
10 "Here's the thing. Life is an endless series of train wrecks with only brief commerical-like breaks of happiness" #Deadpool
11 #suicidesquad #CaptainAmericaCivilWar #XMenApocalypse and #DoctorStrange gotta impress after #deadpool We'll forget about #BatmanvSuperman
12 Congratulations @blakelively and @VancityReynolds! #Deadpool sure was a hit with everyone!! #baby2
13 @TheRealStanLee The fights were awesome but everything else sucked balls. #Deadpool was way better. Batman kicking ass is always good though
14 Just as awesome the second time around. #Deadpool
15 Dear @VancityReynolds, if #Deadpool is ever with #IronMan and #DrStrange, please find a reason for him to say, "No shit, Sherlocks."
16 My #Deadpool #Tee design is on #sale, 20% off 'til Sun. At my @NeatoShop store #deadpoolmovie #marvel #tshirts #http://www.neatoshop.com
17 Fox should digitally insert #Deadpool into the god awful #Fan4stic to just clown on the movie
18 Some people say awards don’t mean anything. Those people are losers. #Deadpool
19 @VancityReynolds amazing job on the first #Deadpool! please make sure #Deadpool2 is even BETTER than the first one!
20 #DemDebate z gonna be like #Deadpool vs #Ajax fight in the move - just gonna be in a more diplomatic way :)
21 Then watched #Deadpool and my faith has been restored.  #awesome  D
22 #deadpool was amazing
23 How is it news to say there will be #Deadpool 2? That's like saying we breathe air: a given. #movienews #movies
24 @deadpoolmovie @VancityReynolds @edskrein I seriously get confused everytime I see Francis's name as Ajax lol to me he's Francis!! #Deadpool
25 Listen up: 12Mass (@12mass, 16675 followers) is dead, they haven't tweeted for 206 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool
26 #Deadpool sequel officially confirmed! Can't wait for #Cable to show up. I still think @IAmStephenLang should play him. #Deadpool2 #Marvel
27 I think I'm the only person who really did not like #deadpool!  Any1 else? #cinema #movie
28 I think #SuicideSquad #DoctorStrange an #Deadpool will be the best movies this year... beating #CivilWar and #BatmanvSuperman easily.
29 Deadpool - *waves around broken hands* "All of the dinosaurs feared the T-Rex" 😂 #Deadpool #amwatching
30 Ok things are looking up, the soundtrack is good and I've been assured the worst bit is over. #Deadpool
31 @eonline @VancityReynolds @blakelively New #deadpool baby? If its a boy, they can name him "Wade".
32 Just saw #Deadpool and I can not believe the level of violence that is being peddled to our children! The pegging scene was cool tho.
33 As of today, the producers of #Deadpool have made a 1200% return/profit on their investment. Owo retirement.....
34 I'm a huge #Deadpool fan, loved the first one. Greeeeat news that #Deadpool2 is officially happening - freakin awesome!
35 @VancityReynolds So many jokes to be made. Imagine the possibilities! Pure nerd boner. #Deadpool #Cable #Marvel #UnicornSex #Chimichangas #$
36 Retweeted Joshua Ovenshire (@TheJovenshire):  Ryan Reynolds now officially signed on for #Deadpool 2. Time for more chimichangas plz!
37 Didn't think I could love Ryan Reynolds anymore than I already do. #deadpool
38 For the last time... Stop calling! If you want to stay home, stay! But i'll out getting that #DeadPool
39 @DReynolds5294 Hope it gets better. #Deadpool is a feel good story ;)
40 Can #Deadpool2 be like a makeover film, like he gets surgery and looks like Ryan Reynolds again? #yum #DeadPool
41 Can't wait to watch #cable in #deadpool 2!! @VancityReynolds @deadpoolmovie
42 @JohnCena why don't you go for the role of Cable in Deadpool 2 you look part. #marvel #deadpool #Deadpool2 #
43 You don't need to be the super hero  To get the girl , the right girl  Will bring out the hero in you . 💯👌 #deadpool
44 @Junkie_XL Hey! I'm heading to your #Deadpool LP signing next week! Would it be cool if you also signed my #MadMax and #BVS Records too??
45 'Deadpool' producer 'would love to see' Spider-Man crossover film. #Marvel #Producer #Spiderman #Deadpool #Movies
46 @FilmHyp It was confirmed by #Deadpool himself before that. What more proof does one need?
47 Am I the only one in the world who didn't like #Deadpool?  I'm a huge comics fan but I was bored as hell through that entire movie.
48 2016: the cinematic year of the super-powered anti-hero #Deadpool #BatmanvsSuperman #SuicideSquad #CivilWar
49 Watched #deadpool this week - great film
50 #deadpool part 2 is CONFIRMED!!!!
51 The #DEADPOOL is the best, most fun superhero movie you'll get this year.
52 I saw #Deadpool and I was legitimately scared of some of the white people in that movie theatre
53 I really am absolutely sick of hearing about #SuicideSquad. The promotion for it is almost on a #Deadpool level. Harley this, Joker that.
54 @NY_Comic_Con @deadpoolmovie @EW @VancityReynolds I'm cocked, locked, and ready to rock again!!!! #Deadpool =D
55 Last night I dreamed I was in a gunfight in a warehouse (I was on the good side).  It was epic. And I was dating @LethalDeadpool  #Deadpool
56 #Deadpool 2 has been given the ready, set go advance. Just what the world needs, more raunchy R rated comedy, but people love it.
57 #Deadpool is the greatest movie of the year omg 💖💖💖 #RyanReynoldsIsSexyNoMatterWhat #ILoveHimSoMuch 😻💞💞💞💖 #Unicorn
58 Amazing Film #Deadpool 2
59 @VancityReynolds Taking the nephew to see Deadpool for his 3rd (my 4th) time. #deadpool #fan

61 "What are you gonna tell her?" "Fuck me." "Maybe don't start with that." #Deadpool
62 #Celebrating my close friend's #19th #birthday with #pizza &amp; #coke &amp; #Deadpool :'D💜🌟✨ I love U all my #Warrior family!❤ #Livetothefullest 👊
1 Can't wait for #Deadpool to drop on DVD
2 Okay, #Deadpool is by far one of the best movies I've watched recently. Waiting for a sequel.
3 You don't have to be a hero to get the girl. The right girl, will get out the hero in you #Deadpool

11 #stusonelinereview #deadpool over the top violence, over the top humour, over the top acting, good fun 7/10 (Non superhero shiz person)
12 @freddurst  what do you think about the talk from #Deadpool about #Limpbizkit in the movie? I think it is awesome!
13 Just finished watching #Deadpool And thought is was brilliant 👍🏻⚔🔫
14 'Let's go talk to the professor' 'mcavoy or Stewart?' Morta sempre #deadpool
15 Looks like elopay (@elopay_com, 130 followers) bit the dust, they haven't tweeted for 180 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool
16 4 5/5's so far this year. #Deadpool, #TheWitch, #10CloverfieldLane and #JungleBook. I have a feeling my top 10 this year will be the hardest
17 I went into #Deadpool thinking it was going to be nonstop pop culture references and a grating main character. Yup. About right. #film
18 Regrettably MyBigAmbitions (@mybigambitions, 10681 followers) has perished, they haven't tweeted for 180 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool

22 @mashable eh did you see #Deadpool? Nailed it!!
23 #HarleyQuinn needs to meet #Deadpool #thatwouldbesomefuckedupshitrightthere

29 @TheMattKey @CraveOnline I think I'm more stoked for #spiderman and #deadpool together on the big screen. Amiright @CoyJandreau ?
30 Do you suppose #Disney would let #Touchstone do a Boba Fett movie considering how well #Deadpool did for #20thCenturyFox ?
31 A great year for comic books! #BatmanvSuperman #Deadpool #DrStrange #SuicideSquad #Tarzan #XMenApocalypse #CaptainAmericaCivilWar #TMNT2

34 Also got home to a #Deadpool hoodie! 😊 Can't wait to wear this bad boy 😄 Thank you #teamdbt @DarkBunnyTees @Mattdarkbunny @TimWestiefish
35 Thank you, #Deadpool and @VancityReynolds for being absolutely hilarious. Never have meta references and self irony been better.
36 Watching #deadpool 👍😊
37 If #punisher gets his own show that means #deadpool will guest star rite? Cc: @marvel
38 Team Red is my new favorite thing #Daredevil #SpiderMan #Deadpool
39 #Deadpool was good. But, I'm having an aneurysm envisioning bro-dudes coming from it going "YAH BRO ALL COMIC MOVIES SHOULD BE LIKE THAT!"
40 @eweniverse #Deadpool or Deadwool?
41 That was the stupidest film I've ever seen. I loved it! #Deadpool
42 How was #Deadpool for you? It's my first time watching it
43 It seems Ariticmail (@ariticmail, 4407 followers) is bereft of life. There have been no tweets for 180 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool
44 @robertliefeld Congratulations! He was birthed from you brain! #Deadpool #Chimichanga
45 And as i got home now my father randomly complimented this shirt too (he doesn't even know #Deadpool )
46 @robertliefeld I will believe it when I see it, I still say #Deadpool is the best marvel movie so far.
47 All the hate on @robertliefeld one fact remains; he gets printed, you don't. Plus he created #Deadpool
48 Just a few of the books you should pick up this week! #starwars #c3po #xena #gwenpool #deadpool #moonknight
49 I wonder how many times one has to watch deadpool for it not be this hilarious... #DarkHumour #GoodJobMarvel #Deadpool
50 @VancityReynolds why not have a scene with #Deadpool trying to poke somebody to death and calling it deathpoke?
51 #DoctorStrange bae it's gonna be  awesome! @Marvel love you forever &amp; ever ! #Deadpool &amp; now #DoctorStrange you people are going too kill me
52 "Come, Wade.  We will go talk to the Professor." "Which one? Stewart or McAvoy? These timelines are so confusing." #Deadpool
53 If you like Action, gore, comedy and  sheggin', watch #Deadpool lol.
54 Literally love #Deadpool can't get enough 😀
55 @deadpoolmovie @VancityReynolds @mcmorgSoNiA  Wow! Now that's how you do a #NotASuperHero movie! #Deadpool 2 now please! 😀
56 I understand that the film's rated R and all, but it'd be great if @Facebook messenger had #Deadpool stickers. Ammiright @VancityReynolds?
57 Is Deadpool worth watching? #Deadpool
58 #Deadpool or #BatmanvSuperman?  What was the better #Comicbook movie?
59 @ShirleySetia actually I like Hindi Dubbed Hollywood Movies like #DeadPool 😂😂 , and Excited to watch #Junglebook ☺
60 Working out so I can get my Ajax body so I can cosplay as Ajax for the upcoming cons #notfrancis #deadpool
61 So #CriminalMovie has #Deadpool, #WonderWoman, Commissioner Gordon, and Jonathan Kent? Might be worth checking out
62 #Deadpool  is still an advanced and latest version of #SpiderMan for parents. #LullzFact
63 I wonder what part(s) of #Deadpool @Marie_Lanza liked the most or if it was more of an overall enjoyment of the film
64 @edskrein @missmorenab #Deadpool made me laugh until my sides ached.😂😂😂👌🏼
65 #Deadpool  Marvel has been changed since from when I know it! Spiderman was well made movie, but deadpool is out of speech!
66 Bless the beautiful job they did with the #Deadpool movie. Just...so glad it is so amazing. I need its ridiculousness ♥
67 Looks like BornBarefoot (@bornbarefootuk, 1841 followers) bit the dust, they haven't tweeted for 180 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool
68 Who do you think would win in a battle between #Thor and #Deadpool? #TheyAreSlowlyTurningMeIntoANerd
69 When you finally found the best fucking serious ass, comedy-fucking action movie !!!  #DEADPOOL
70 "4th wall break inside a 4th wall break. That's like 16 walls 😱" #Deadpool
71 Deadpool: Wanna use me for a dartboard? #Deadpool
72 If I had a parrot. I would teach it dead pool lines. #Deadpool #parrots
73 What does "cock-juggling" even means, Ryan lol #Deadpool #Blade3
74 So #Deadpool is just #archer with a mask on eh?
75 Fucking hell!! I've been waiting for this. #deadpool
76 #DeadPool-Scopes You Don't need to be a superhero .. The Right girl will bring out the Super Hero in you ..
1 @drafthouse matinee for #BatmanvSuperman then food and drinks @voxtable then back to #Alamo for #Deadpool! #bestday @haley_hickock
2 Oooooooh how good is #Deadpool ?! I know I'm a bit late to the party but #wow so much fun!! #movies #awesome #RyanReynolds
3 I predict #DrStrange won't perform as well as #Deadpool or #SuicideSquad but will probably make money at domestic than #XMenApocalypse
4 Every time I see the trailer for #Criminal all I can think is, #Deadpool, #WonderWoman &amp; Clark Kent's dad made a movie together.
5 Finally getting to see #deadpool with @steff_travers

10 @ComedyCentral #DeadPool @VancityReynolds @missmorenab Gotta save this video for next year's International Women's Day... ;)
11 Well, I've put it off for a long time but I can now confirm.... that #Deadpool is a fantastically funny movie, from opening credits to end.
12 #Deadpool is extremely funny all the way to the perfect movie geek reference in the post credits scene. Really needed the subtitles!

42 I know it will never happen, but I think @RyanReynolds should get an Oscar nom for his performance as #Deadpool, and I'm dead serious.
43 Random stat for today. #Deadpool grossed $756.8 million  from just a $58 million budget! Insane profitably isn't it
44 Currently drinking red wine, eating bread sticks and watching #Deadpool  #happytuesdaypeople
45 Why is everyone so surprised at #Deadpool's success? It's the role @VancityReynolds was born to play.
46 It seems Glamble Gaming Network (@glamble, 7330 followers) bought the farm, they haven't tweeted for 180 days #Deathwatch #Deadpool
